# vyuh-vim

My own vim module (some day this might become).
Presently only a cli colorscheme
that looks good on cterm.
I hope `cterm` means any terminal with at least 256 colors.

To install copy the file `colors/vyuh.vim` in this repo
to `~/.vim/colors/vyuh.vim`.

Use `colorscheme vyuh` to activate.
Add that to `~/.vimrc` to make this default colorscheme.

If you're a pro (elite),
add the above stuff to your
custom vim directory and
run control file.
I don't think I need to instruct you if you're one.
So.
Anyway.
Cheers.
